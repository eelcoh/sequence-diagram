# Navigate through SVG Sequence Diagrams

This library is about creating Sequence Diagrams, with the main purpose of them being presenting them on screen.

## Example
The examples directory has a single example.

If you don't have Elm installed yet, go to [elm-lang.org] first.

Clone this repository, and cd into the sequence-diagram directory. Install the dependencies:
```
$ elm-package install
```

Run the reactor:
```
$ elm-reactor
```
